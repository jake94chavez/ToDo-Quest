# ToDo-Quest

ToDo-Quest is a gameified ToDo list that adds an rpg aspect to a regular ToDo list. When one starts using the app, one will be able to add ToDos to their personal list. The user is prompted to set a difficulty or importance of the task as well as when the task is due. Once the ToDo is in the list, if it is completed before it is due. The user will gain experience points for that task based on its difficulty. If the user doesn't complete the task they will lose health points. Upon reaching 0 health points, the user will lose a level.

## Motivation
One of my biggest weaknesses is organization. If I don't stay on top of all of my tasks, I can lose track of things I need to do very quickly if I don't stay on top of it. I thought it would be fun to enhance a regular task manager with a gameified element. This kills two birds with one stone. It makes a ToDo list more interesting which will attract people that otherwise wouldn't use a ToDo list to start using one. On top of that, it adds another reason to complete the tasks you put on the list.
